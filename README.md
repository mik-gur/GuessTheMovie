# GuessTheMovie

Exercise from Udacity where you must build a game for guessing movie titles, list is [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a3732ea_movies/movies.txt)

With the following steps:

1. Write some code that will simply read the movie list and display the whole list.
2. Then add to your code to randomly pick one movie and display that title only.
3. Then convert its letters to underscores (_) and display that instead, and so on.
4. Once you've got that part done start reading the user's input and search for it in the title.
5. Work on revealing the correct letters and displaying them.
6. Add the logic to keep track of wrong letters so they don't lose points for guessing the same letter twice.
7. After that, you can keep track of how many wrong guesses and end the game if they lose.
8. Finally, detect when they have guessed all the letters and let them know they've won!
